# Image_Super_Resolution

This mini project is an implementation of the SRCNN ( super resolution convolutional neural network), proposed in this 2014 research paper: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html by Chao Dong, Chen Change Loy, Kaiming He and Xiaoou Tang.

The resulting images are tested using the following metrics:- 

  Peak signal to noise ratio    
  Mean squared error  
  Structural similarity index


The results on a few sample images can be found in the output and output2 directories.
